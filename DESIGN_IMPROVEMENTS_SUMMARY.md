## üìù Content & Jargon Explanations

### Acronyms Expanded

#### DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)
**Before:** Just shown as "DSCR"
**Now:**
- Tooltip: "Measures how comfortably rental income covers mortgage payments. DSCR > 1.25 is generally considered safe by lenders."
- Used consistently across all instances

#### ROI (Return on Investment)
**Before:** Just "ROI"
**Now:**
- Tooltip: "Net profit relative to total cash invested (purchase + refurb - refinance proceeds)."
- Clear definition in context

#### LTV (Loan-to-Value)
**Before:** Just shown as percentage
**Now:**
- Tooltip: "Loan-to-Value after remortgage. 75% LTV means borrowing 75% of post-refurb value."

#### EPC (Energy Performance Certificate)
**Before:** Used without explanation
**Now:**
- Full section description: "Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) shows the property's energy efficiency rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient)"

#### VAT (Value Added Tax)
**Before:** Mentioned but not explained
**Now:**
- "All costs include VAT (Value Added Tax at 20%) unless marked 'ex VAT'"

#### OpEx (Operating Expenses)
**Before:** Just "opex"
**Now:**
- Explained as "operating expenses" in context

### Section Descriptions Enhanced

#### Investor Metrics
**Before:** "Backend-calculated metrics are authoritative. Sliders model sensitivities only..."
**After:** "Key financial performance indicators for this investment. DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) measures how comfortably rent covers mortgage payments ‚Äì values above 1.25 are preferred by lenders. Yield on Cost shows annual rental return as a percentage of total investment (purchase + refurbishment). ROI (Return on Investment) calculates your profit relative to cash invested."

#### Refurbishment Budget
**Before:** "Refurbishment costs by room with VAT-inclusive totals..."
**After:** "Detailed room-by-room renovation cost estimates. All amounts include VAT (Value Added Tax at 20%) unless marked 'ex VAT'. Costs are AI-estimated from property images and UK market rates. Rooms with ¬£0 budget require no refurbishment work. Use filters below to view specific room types or sort by cost."

#### EPC & Building Fabric
**Before:** "Fabric & systems snapshot from EPC and listing cues..."
**After:** "Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) shows the property's energy efficiency rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). The fabric section details heating systems, insulation, windows, and building construction. EPC improvement costs are included in the total refurbishment budget above."

#### Financial Scenarios
**Completely Redesigned:**
- Added info box with icon
- Clear bullet points for each scenario:
  - **Inputs:** Starting assumptions including purchase price, estimated rental income, and operating expenses (OpEx)
  - **Exit: Sell:** Shows profit if you renovate and sell. Focus on Net Profit and ROI (Return on Investment) to evaluate flip potential
  - **Exit: Refi (Refinance):** For buy-to-let hold strategy. Key metrics: Net Cash Left In after remortgage, and DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio - rental income vs. mortgage payments)
