\section*{1. Introduction}
This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the commitments, responsibilities, and expectations between \textbf{\product} (the ``Provider'') and beta testers, pilot users, or paying subscribers (the ``Customer'') regarding the availability, performance, and support of the \product\ platform.

The SLA is designed to provide transparency and confidence while acknowledging that the platform is in a \textbf{Beta stage}, during which improvements, changes, and occasional instability may occur.

\section*{2. Scope of Services}
The SLA covers:
\begin{itemize}[left=0pt]
  \item Web application access (demo, dashboard, exports).
  \item API services (analysis pipeline, metrics, feedback logging).
  \item Document exports (PDF, Excel).
  \item Community support (Discord server, email).
\end{itemize}

Excluded from this SLA are:
\begin{itemize}[left=0pt]
  \item Third-party dependencies (e.g. property portals, external APIs, payment providers).
  \item User devices, internet connections, or environments outside Providerâ€™s control.
  \item Force majeure events (natural disasters, global outages, war, government restrictions).
\end{itemize}
